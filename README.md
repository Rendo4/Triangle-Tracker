## Triangle Tracker with Jest

This is a basic demonstration project that uses Jest. Note that testing and source code does not include edge cases. Here are some sample edge cases:

* User enters 0 for 1 or more lengths (shouldn't be a valid triangle);
* User enters a non-number value (invalid input);
* User enters a negative number (invalid input).
